# Hi-Tech Scarecrow Daily Report <br/><br/><br/>

## 2018/12/31 Mon.

### First Discussion - Choosing ways about in what way we will make "Hi-Tech Scarecrow"
1. Drone
2. Machine Learning
3. IoT

### Drone
- Benefits - 
- Difficulties - Weather can be a big problem. For example, Drone is not available when it is windy or rainy.

```
### Solution

1. Loud Noise
2. Lazer
3. Specific Frequency
4. Specific Smell

### Problem
1. It might be a lot noisy if it is too loud or sounds often.
2. Battery Problem.
3. Difficult to implement.
```
  
  
### Research
  1. Birds cannot distinguish the color "YELLOW"

<br/><br/><br/>

### Research
  1. Birds get scared of green lights as they recognize those as predators eyes.
  2. We can shoot a lazer randomly.

### Draft Presentation at 2:30 ( Presenter - Jinwoo Nam )
<br/><br/><br/>
## 2019/01/04 Fri. & 2019/01/07 Mon.

### Paper
1. looking for some reference papers.

```
Decided a direction of our project. 
- Chasing birds away with green light.
- It might be various colors, and some patterns as birds' learning effect is very important.
- We use both sound and light.
- What about using Ultrasonic?
```

### Equipments we need for hardware
```
1. Bar
2. Megaphone
3. Green Light Bulb
4. Arduino
5. Relay Module
6. web cam (SONY or Raspberry Pi CAM)
7. Raspberry Pi
```
- We asked Professor Eric about these.
- Eunseo gave us some equipments they have.
- Eunseo said that we are able to do the project without Arduino.( Not sure but with Raspberry Pie)

### Things we've got from Eunseo and Eric today.
```
1. Two Raspberry Pie with SD cards.
2. One Raspberry Pie CAM
3. Two Monitors, keyboards and mouse.
```

### Install Opencv with Raspberry Pi.
- try detection.py with Raspberry Pi.
- detected a movement with Threshold.

### playing eagle sound, when the camera detects any movement.
1. studied about playing mp3 in Python.
2. when the camera detects the movement, put playing method in the frameDiff Method

<br/><br/><br/>
## 2019/01/11 Fri.

### Install Opencv with laptops
1. tested the same code in laptop (worked)
2. find some equipments we need to buy.

```
Multi adaptor to use 4 cameras.
```

<br/><br/><br/>
## 2019/01/28 Mon.

### Things we've done
```
1. Detecting motions with opencv
2. Turning on the light bulb with arduino.
3. Communication between Raspberry Pi LoRa and Arduino LoRa.
4. when the motion is detected, the light is on.
```

### Things we have to do
```
1. Laser sensor ( Garage Door sensor ) for detecting deers at night.
2. Research about what deers are afraid of
```

### Prepare mid presentation

<br/><br/><br/>
## 2019/02/01 Fri.

### mid presentation

<br/><br/><br/>
## 2019/02/04 Mon.

### Things we've done
```
1. implementing code about IR laser sensor. ( test too )
2. 1 to Many Communication with LoRa. ( setting bandwidth, frequency, spreading factor.
```
